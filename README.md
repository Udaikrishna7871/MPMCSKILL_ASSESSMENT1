# MPMCSKILL_ASSESSMENT1
# FACTORIAL-OF-A-NUMBER_STORES DATA
# FACTORIAL OF A NUMBER USING 8051 (Keil)

## AIM
To Write an assembly language program in 8051 to find the factorial of a given  number and store the result in memory.

---

## APPARATUS REQUIRED
- Personal computer with Keil software

---

### Algorithm

1. Start the program
2. Set DPTR = 4500H
3. Read number N from memory (4500H) into A
4. Move A → R0 (store N in R0)
5. Set A = 1 (initialize result)
6. Repeat:

   * Move R0 → B
   * Multiply A × B → result in A
   * Decrement R0
   * If R0 ≠ 1, repeat loop
7. Increment DPTR (to 4501H)
8. Store result (A) to memory (4501H)
9. Stop the program
